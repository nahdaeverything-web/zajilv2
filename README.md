# Zajil — React/Next port (`next/`)

The rebuild of Zajil as a static-export Next.js app, implementing the frozen
specs in `../design/approved/` — **not** the current vanilla screens. Where a
spec and today's app differ, the spec wins; `../design/README.md` says where
that is deliberate. The vanilla app in the repo root keeps running untouched
until a cutover ruling.

## Rules that are enforced, not remembered

- `npm run build` runs `guards/run.mjs` first (`prebuild`). Palette, no root
  imports, `<html lang="ar" dir="rtl">`, no gradients / blurred shadows, no
  dynamic route segments. Each guard was proved to fire by reintroducing its
  violation — see the Phase 0.5 commit.
- `output: 'export'` — no server, ever. Record views take `?id=`, never `[id]`.
- Everything outside `next/` is read-only during the port. `next/` imports
  nothing from `../js`, `../css` or `../tools` (guarded); the engine and the
  dataset id mapper are byte-identical copies under `src/engine/` and `tests/`.

## Tests

    node tests/run.js        # the root engine suite against src/engine/ — 33/33

## Two files you did not write

`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are **create-next-app output**: Next.js API
guidance for coding agents, re-added by `next dev` if removed. They are not
Zajil project rules — those live in the root `HANDOFF.md`, `BACKLOG.md` and
`design/README.md`. Each carries a first-line comment saying so.

## Fonts

Self-hosted under `public/fonts/` (OFL 1.1, licences beside the faces), wired
through `app/fonts.ts`. Alexandria is one variable file subset to Arabic +
Latin; IBM Plex Mono is the two static weights the specs load.
