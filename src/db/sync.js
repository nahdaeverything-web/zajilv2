// db/sync.js — accounts and the Supabase session.
//
// v1.9 Phase 2 installs the auth half: sign-in, sign-out, and the refresh
// loop. Push and pull land here in Phases 3 and 4 (SYNC-DESIGN §8).
//
// THE RULE THAT SHAPES THIS FILE: auth is required to SYNC, not to FUNCTION.
// Nothing here is on the path of any existing feature. The register, pedigrees,
// COI, breeding, certificates — all of it runs against IndexedDB and does not
// know this file exists. A device that can never reach the network, or was
// never configured at all, is a fully working Zajil. Every function below can
// fail, and none of those failures may reach the app.
//
// NETWORK FAILURE IS NOT AN AUTH VERDICT.
// This is the distinction the whole file is built around, because conflating
// the two is how apps sign people out for no reason. `fetch` rejecting means
// the phone is in a loft with no signal; a 5xx means the server is unwell.
// Neither says anything about whether the session is valid, so neither may
// ever clear a token. Only a 4xx with an auth body is the server actually
// saying "no", and only that clears the session.
//
// AN API KEY IS NEVER A BEARER VALUE (SPIKE §1). The publishable key travels
// in the `apikey` header and nowhere else; `Authorization: Bearer` carries the
// user's access token and nothing else. They are different kinds of thing, and
// the one time they were swapped in the spike the server's refusal was
// confusing rather than obvious.
