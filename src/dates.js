// dates.js — local-calendar date handling.
//
// WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
// Zajil stores dates as ISO Gregorian strings, and most of them are date-ONLY
// ("2026-03-14": a hatch date, a laying date). JavaScript gets both ends of
// that wrong by default:
//
//   1. `new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)` is the UTC date. East of
//      Greenwich, between local midnight and the UTC offset, it names
//      YESTERDAY. In Jordan (UTC+3) an egg logged at 01:00 was dated to the
//      previous day.
//   2. `new Date("2026-03-14")` is parsed as UTC midnight. West of Greenwich
//      that instant is still the 13th locally, so a stored date RENDERS one
//      day early.
//
// A calendar date has no timezone — it is a label, not an instant. Everything
// in the app must go through here so the two mistakes cannot be reintroduced;
// tests/guards.test.js fails the build if a raw UTC slice appears elsewhere.
//
// This module is dependency-free and pure, so the node suite can exercise it
// directly with fixed instants.

/**
 * Normalise any ISO-8601 timestamp to the exact form `nowISO()` produces.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every timestamp comparison in sync is lexicographic on ISO
 * strings, which is only valid while both sides are written the same way.
 * Postgres serialises `timestamptz` as `2026-08-29T12:00:00+00:00`; `nowISO()`
 * produces `2026-08-29T12:00:00.000Z`. Those are the SAME INSTANT, and `+`
 * (0x2B) sorts before `.` (0x2E) — so a pulled row and a local op describing
 * the same moment compare as unequal, and each device concludes that ITS OWN
 * copy is the later one. Two devices then reach opposite verdicts about the
 * same conflict and never converge.
 *
 * So server timestamps are normalised on arrival and nothing downstream — the
 * conflict rule, tombstone comparison, export merging — has to know that more
 * than one spelling exists.
 *
 * An unparseable value is returned unchanged rather than turned into a
 * fabricated date: a comparison against nonsense should look wrong, not
 * plausible.
