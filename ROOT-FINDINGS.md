# Root and spec findings surfaced by the port

Two kinds of entry, both surfaced by the React port while copying the vanilla
tree and re-proving it against the approved designs:

- **ROOT findings** — inconsistencies in the **vanilla** tree (everything
  outside `next/`).
- **SPEC findings** — defects in an **approved design file** under
  `design/approved/`. Ruled in at 4D acceptance. The specs are frozen, so
  these are not edited either; the port states what it did instead, and why
  the intent was not in doubt.

Neither tree is written to during the port. Each entry names the file and
line, what is wrong, why it matters, and what the port did about it on its own
side. They land in the root `BACKLOG.md` as one docs commit at Phase 7.

Rule for adding to this file: an entry needs a `file:line`, a reproduction,
and the port-side handling. An observation without evidence does not go in.

## RF-1 — `tests/e2e/write_boundary.py` hardcodes the server port

**Where:** [`tests/e2e/write_boundary.py:19`](../tests/e2e/write_boundary.py#L19)
```python
page.goto('http://127.0.0.1:8123/',wait_until='networkidle'); page.wait_for_timeout(800)
```
**What:** every other local suite reads `ZAJIL_URL` (29 of 32 files under
`tests/e2e/`); this one does not, so `ZAJIL_URL` has no effect on it.

**Why it matters:** it is the R6 class of defect — a test that talks to a
server it did not start. Point the runner at any other port and this suite
still tests whatever is (or is not) on 8123: a stale server, another
checkout, or nothing. In the port it went to an empty port and failed with
`undefined.importAll`, which is how it was found; against a forgotten server
it would have passed about the wrong tree.

**Port handling:** the copy at `next/tests/e2e/write_boundary.py` reads
`ZAJIL_URL` — a URL-only change, permitted by the Phase 2 order. Root
untouched.

**Fix at source (Phase 7):** `page.goto(os.environ.get('ZAJIL_URL', 'http://127.0.0.1:8123/'), …)` — the idiom its siblings use.

---

## RF-2 — root browser suites exit 0 on assertion failure

**Where:** 28 of the 31 local suites in `tests/e2e/` end by printing a
summary and never call `sys.exit`. Two representatives:
- [`tests/e2e/resurrection.py:127`](../tests/e2e/resurrection.py#L127) — `print(f'\n{ok} passed, {fail} failed')`, last line
- [`tests/e2e/tombstones.py:121`](../tests/e2e/tombstones.py#L121) — same

Only `auth_live.py`, `pull_live.py` and `push_live.py` exit nonzero on
failure.

**What:** the process exit code is 0 whether `fail` is 0 or 20. The ONLY
thing that converts failures into a nonzero exit is the runner —
[`tests/e2e/run_all.py:63`](../tests/e2e/run_all.py#L63) parses the
`… failed` token out of the summary text,
[`:67`](../tests/e2e/run_all.py#L67) flags the suite, and
[`:81`](../tests/e2e/run_all.py#L81) exits 1.

**Why it matters:** anyone who runs a suite directly
(`python3 tests/e2e/tombstones.py`), chains one with `&&`, or wires one into
CI without the runner gets **green on red**. Reproduced during the Phase 2
mutation proof: with tombstones deliberately broken, `resurrection.py`
printed `12 passed, 4 failed` and exited **0**. A suite whose exit code
cannot say "failed" is green-that-proves-nothing outside the one script that
knows to read its stdout.

**Port handling:** `next/tests/e2e/*.py` are verbatim copies except the
module token, so they inherit this; `next/tests/e2e/run_all.py` mirrors the
root runner's parsing and is the gate. The port's own new test
(`next/tests/bridge/react_bridge.py`) exits 1 on failure.

**Fix at source (Phase 7):** append `sys.exit(1 if fail else 0)` after the
summary print in each suite (28 one-line changes), and keep the runner's
parse as belt-and-braces. Then a direct run means what it says.

## RF-3 — the free-tier dev project auto-pauses (ops, not code)

**What:** the dev Supabase project (`thfxijqzxzdttsuqriwn`) is on the free
tier, which **pauses a project after ~7 days idle**. A paused project's
hostname is withdrawn from DNS while the `supabase.co` apex keeps resolving.

**How it presented (2026-09-11):** every live suite failed at the first
network call with `AuthError('network')` — `js/db/sync.js:160`, the branch
for a fetch that rejects — from both the port *and* the vanilla tree (root
control). `getent hosts thfxijqzxzdttsuqriwn.supabase.co` returned nothing;
`curl` returned 000 "Could not resolve host". Last live traffic before that
was ~4 Sept. Restoring the project in the dashboard cleared it.

**Why it matters:** it blocks **every** live suite (`auth_live`, `push_live`,
`pull_live`, `live_deployment`) and looks, from the client, exactly like an
outage. Anyone running the live gates after a quiet week will see a red
network failure that no code change can fix.

**Port handling:** none needed — the classification is correct. Recorded so
the next person checks the dashboard before debugging DNS.

**At source (Phase 7 / release):** production runs on **Pro** (release
checklist) and does not pause. For the dev project: either keep it warm
(any authenticated request inside the window) or expect to unpause it before
a live run. Worth one line in the live suites' header comments.

## RF-4 — a bird share fails outright when an ancestor's photo is on another device

**Where:** [`js/db/io.js:237`](../js/db/io.js#L237), reached from
[`js/db/io.js:222`](../js/db/io.js#L222) `exportBirdWithAncestry(birdId, { includeMedia: true })`
```js
mediaOut.push({ ...m, blob: undefined, dataURL: await blobToDataURL(m.blob) });
```
and [`js/db/io.js:18`](../js/db/io.js#L18)
```js
function blobToDataURL(blob) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const r = new FileReader();
    r.onload = () => resolve(r.result);
    r.onerror = () => reject(r.error);
    r.readAsDataURL(blob);          // blob is undefined here
  });
}
```

**What:** a media row whose bytes are on **another device** has metadata and no
`blob`. `readAsDataURL(undefined)` throws a `TypeError` inside the promise
executor, so the promise rejects and the **whole export** fails. Not the one
photo: the entire share, birds and pedigree and races included.

**Why it matters:** this is not an edge case, it is the designed steady state.
SYNC-DESIGN §7 is explicit that **metadata syncs and blobs do not**, so every
record pulled from another device arrives exactly this way. A fancier on a
second device therefore cannot share any bird whose ancestor carries a photo
taken on the first. The live app has this today: the profile's «مشاركة»
(`js/views/bird-detail.js:83`) calls the same function with the same options,
and vanilla attaches no rejection handler, so the button does nothing at all —
no file, no message.

**Reproduction** (the port's certificate suite does this, and asserts around it —
`next/tests/e2e/screens/certificate.py`):
```js
const m = await db.addMedia(sireId, 'photo', 'body', 'sire.png', new Blob(['x']));
const row = await db.idbGet('media', m.id);
delete row.blob;                       // what a pull leaves behind
await db.idbPut('media', row);
await db.exportBirdWithAncestry(birdId, { includeRaces: true, includeMedia: true });
// → TypeError: Failed to execute 'readAsDataURL' on 'FileReader'
```

**Port handling:** the root is read-only, so the copy at `next/src/db/io.js` is
**byte-identical to main** and was not touched. What the port changed is its own
side: both share paths now attach a rejection handler and say so —
`next/app/cert/view.tsx:216` and `next/app/bird/view.tsx:116`, raising
`err.exportFailed` («تعذّر تجهيز الملف للمشاركة.»). A share that cannot be made
must not silently do nothing. `next/tests/e2e/screens/certificate.py` asserts the
contract that holds either way: **a share always answers**, with the file or with
the reason.

**Fix at source (Phase 7):** skip the rows with no local bytes and export the rest,
rather than failing the export. The metadata is still worth carrying, so the
receiving device knows a photo exists:
```diff
   if (includeMedia) {
     for (const id of ids) {
       for (const m of await mediaForBird(id)) {
-        mediaOut.push({ ...m, blob: undefined, dataURL: await blobToDataURL(m.blob) });
+        // SYNC-DESIGN §7: metadata syncs, blobs do not. A row pulled from another
+        // device has no bytes HERE, which is normal — carry the metadata and say
+        // the file is elsewhere rather than failing the whole export.
+        mediaOut.push({ ...m, blob: undefined,
+                        dataURL: m.blob ? await blobToDataURL(m.blob) : null });
       }
     }
   }
```
`importAll` already validates every `dataURL` before touching the database
([`js/db/io.js:108-119`](../js/db/io.js#L108)), so the null case must be admitted
there in the same commit:
```diff
-    let blob;
-    try { blob = await dataURLToBlob(m.dataURL); }
-    catch (err) { throw new Error(`bad-media: ${m.name || m.id} could not be decoded`); }
-    if (!blob || typeof blob.size !== 'number') throw new Error(`bad-media: ${m.name || m.id}`);
+    let blob = null;
+    if (m.dataURL) {
+      try { blob = await dataURLToBlob(m.dataURL); }
+      catch (err) { throw new Error(`bad-media: ${m.name || m.id} could not be decoded`); }
+      if (!blob || typeof blob.size !== 'number') throw new Error(`bad-media: ${m.name || m.id}`);
+    }
```
with `media.elsewhereFile` («الملف على جهاز آخر») already in the dictionary for the
receiving end to render.

## SF-1 — `certificate-v1.html` puts its phone media query before the base rules it overrides

**Applies to:** `design/approved/certificate-v1.html` **only**. No other approved
spec has this ordering.

**Where:** [`design/approved/certificate-v1.html`](../design/approved/certificate-v1.html) —
the `@media (max-width:700px)` block declares
```css
.zoom-btn{ display:inline-flex; }
.cta{ position:fixed; bottom:0; inset-inline:0; z-index:15; padding:12px 16px calc(12px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom)); }
```
and the base rules that follow it declare
```css
.zoom-btn{ display:none; … }
.cta{ position:sticky; bottom:0; … }
```

**What:** both pairs are single-class selectors, so specificity ties and the
**later** rule wins at every width. The phone rules therefore never apply. In the
prototype as shipped, «تكبير» is `display:none` on every screen size, and the
action bar is `sticky` rather than `fixed` on the phone.

**Why it matters:** the button is the phone's only way to read a scaled-down A4
sheet, and the Phase 4 order names it («mobile scaled preview with «تكبير»»). The
intent is not in doubt from the file itself either: the spec's own
`.opts{ padding: 20px 20px 200px }` and its phone `.opts{ padding:18px 16px 140px }`
exist to clear a bar that is **fixed**, which a sticky bar does not need.

**Port handling:** both phone rules are restated at the end of
`next/app/cert/cert.module.css`, where they win, with the defect named in place.
Nothing else changed. `next/tests/e2e/screens/certificate.py` then measures the
result rather than trusting it: «تكبير» is visible at 430, the action bar reports
`position: fixed`, and ruling C's probe finds the bar and measures a real 299px
clearance above it instead of finding no bar at all.

**Fix at source (design):** move the `@media (max-width:700px)` block after the
base declarations for `.zoom-btn` and `.cta`, which is where every other approved
spec puts its phone block.

---

## SF-2 — the design kit's bird-status list disagreed with the data layer

**RULED at Phase 6 acceptance: the kit was wrong, the data is right, and stored status
lists are NOT migrated. Corrected on `main` in one docs-only commit — the single
authorised edit outside `next/` in the whole port.**

**Where:** [`design/ZAJIL-DESIGN-KIT.md:100-101`](../design/ZAJIL-DESIGN-KIT.md#L100) read
```
· status (نشط/تربية/فريق السباق/ميت/مباع/مفقود)
```
against [`js/db/storage.js:116`](../js/db/storage.js#L116)
```js
const DEFAULT_STATUSES = ['breeder', 'race team', 'young bird', 'stock', 'sold', 'lost', 'dead'];
```
which the dictionary ([`js/i18n.js`](../js/i18n.js), `status.*`) renders as
تربية / فريق السباق / فرخ / احتياط / مباع / مفقود / نافق.

**What:** four disagreements in one line. It invented **«نشط»**, a status the data layer has
never had; it wrote **«ميت»** where the dictionary says **«نافق»**; and it omitted **«فرخ»**
and **«احتياط»**. It also did not mention `REFERENCE_STATUS` («مرجع نسب»,
[`js/db/storage.js:121`](../js/db/storage.js#L121)), which is appended rather than seeded so
it cannot be picked for a real bird by accident.

**Why it matters:** the statuses are not a design list, they are the LOFT'S OWN stored
array — seeded at `initDB()` and carried per loft, so a status the kit names but the data
lacks cannot be rendered without a destructive migration of every existing loft. Four
approved specs draw the «نشط» chip on the strength of that line —
`add-edit-bird-v1.html:199`, `add-edit-bird-v2.html`, `bird-profile-v1.html:217` and
`zajil-prototype.html` — and it is MOCK CONTENT in all four: no build of Zajil, vanilla or
port, has ever rendered it, because there has never been anything to render.

**How it surfaced:** the port's Phase 6 fidelity pass audited all fourteen approved specs
state by state. «نشط» was the only gap that recurred across specs, and four auditors
independently called it a STOP with no authorising ruling. It is the one case in the port
where a spec state had no port state AND the port was right.

**Port handling:** none needed. The status segment and the profile's status chip render the
loft's own list (`next/app/bird/form.tsx`, `next/app/bird/view.tsx`), which is what vanilla
does. 4A acceptance item 4 had already accepted dropping the profile's hero «نشط» chip on
exactly this basis; this finding is the general case behind that one.

**Fixed at source:** yes, and uniquely so — `design/ZAJIL-DESIGN-KIT.md` now carries the
data layer's list verbatim plus a note that the line must match `DEFAULT_STATUSES` and
nothing else. The four specs are frozen and keep their mock chip; the kit now says so.

## RF-5 — two version strings that disagree, and a grep that can read a comment

**Where:**
- [`package.json:3`](../package.json#L3) — `"version": "1.4.1"`
- [`sw.js:4`](../sw.js#L4) — `const VERSION = 'zajil-v1.9.1';`
- [`HANDOFF.md:38`](../HANDOFF.md#L38) — `| App version (service worker) | zajil-v1.9.1 |`
- [`tests/e2e/version_display.py:11`](../tests/e2e/version_display.py#L11) —
  `re.search(r"const VERSION = '([^']+)'", open('sw.js').read())`

**What:** two separate problems in the same place.

1. The app's version lives in `sw.js` and is maintained by hand. `package.json` says
   `1.4.1`, five releases behind — so the Node package's version is not the app's, and
   nothing notices. [`BACKLOG.md:301`](../BACKLOG.md#L301) already records a
   HANDOFF-vs-`sw.js` agreement check as unbuilt; this is the same gap with a third
   party to it.
2. The suite reads `sw.js` **relative to the working directory**, so it only runs from the
   repo root. Every other local suite is CWD-independent. Run the root runner from anywhere
   else and this one suite errors on a file that is simply somewhere else — which is how the
   port's Phase 6 gate first reported it, having run the root control from `next/`.
   RF-1 is the same class of defect one level down.
3. The suite's grep is **unanchored** and takes the FIRST match in the file. `sw.js` has
   no comment spelling that assignment out today, so it happens to read the constant —
   but a comment that did would make the suite green about the wrong string. The port hit
   exactly this: `sw/sw.template.js` described the requirement in prose, and the first
   match became `'…'` from the comment. Found because the port's postbuild guard and the
   suite disagreed; a single unanchored reader would not have noticed.

**Why it matters:** #1 is the two-sources-of-truth problem the version machinery exists
to prevent, one level up. #2 is a test that can pass while reading a different value than
the one it is validating — the `version_display` #6 assertion ("the row shows what the
worker reports") would still hold against a string nobody ships.

**Port handling:** the port's version has ONE home, `next/package.json`, and
`scripts/build-sw.mjs` composes `'zajil-v' + version` into the generated worker — so the
package version and the app version cannot diverge. Its copy of the suite anchors the
grep (`re.M` with `^`), and `guards/postbuild.mjs` anchors it the same way, with the
template carrying a note that its own prose must never spell the assignment out.

**Fix at source (Phase 7):** resolve `sw.js` from the file's own location
(`os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), '..', '..', 'sw.js')`), as the
port's copy does; derive `sw.js`'s VERSION from `package.json` at release time
(or bump both in one commit and guard the agreement, which is BACKLOG.md:301's item), and
anchor the regex in `tests/e2e/version_display.py:11`:
```diff
-SW_VERSION = re.search(r"const VERSION = '([^']+)'", open('sw.js').read()).group(1)
+SW_VERSION = re.search(r"^const VERSION = '([^']+)'", open('sw.js').read(), re.M).group(1)
```

## RF-6 — twelve document-relative URLs, and the blank page they produced

**Numbered RF-6, not RF-5: the Phase 7 acceptance asked for "RF-5", but that number is
already the two-disagreeing-version-strings finding above.**

**FIXED at source on `main` (`a98b228`) — not by changing these twelve, but by removing the
only condition under which they are wrong.**

**Where:** every one of these resolves against the DOCUMENT's url:

| | file:line | value | resolves to, at `/bird/edit` | consequence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [`index.html:18`](../index.html#L18) | `src="./js/app.js"` | `/bird/js/app.js` | **blank page** — the whole app |
| 2 | [`index.html:12`](../index.html#L12) | `href="./css/app.css"` | `/bird/css/app.css` | unstyled |
| 3 | [`index.html:9`](../index.html#L9) | `href="./manifest.webmanifest"` | `/bird/manifest.webmanifest` | no install |
| 4-5 | [`index.html:10-11`](../index.html#L10) | `href="./icons/icon-192.png"` ×2 | `/bird/icons/…` | no icon |
| 6 | [`js/app.js:267`](../js/app.js#L267) | `register('./sw.js')` | `/bird/sw.js` | **the worker can never re-register or update** |
| 7-9 | [`js/views/birds.js:16,121,122`](../js/views/birds.js#L16) | `'./sample-data.json'`, `'./example-loft-large.json'` | `/bird/…` | the teaching loft dies |
| 10-12 | [`js/views/tools.js:374-375`](../js/views/tools.js#L374) | the same two datasets | `/bird/…` | the Tools buttons die |

`import` is **not** affected — a static or dynamic import resolves against the MODULE's url,
measured across all 99 specifiers under `js/**`, every one served correctly from `/js/…`
while the document sat at `/bird/edit`.

**Why they were harmless until now.** Vanilla routes entirely on `location.hash`, so its
document is only ever AT the scope root — where `./` is right. The single code path that
could serve it anywhere else was [`sw.js`](../sw.js)'s navigation fallback, which answered a
cache-missing navigation with the shell at the requested address. That is now a redirect to
the scope root, so the document is never at the wrong url and all twelve are correct again.

**Why it mattered.** The React port creates path documents (`/bird/edit`, `/bird/new`). A
vanilla redeploy over an origin the port has served puts anyone parked on a two-level path
straight into the blank page, and reloading repeats it.

**Fixed at source:** yes — `a98b228`, `sw.js` only, with four assertions in
`tests/e2e/subpath_hosting.py` each proven to fire.

**Two couplings the redirect creates, both currently safe, both measured:**

1. **`tests/e2e/schema_upgrade.py:17` navigates to a deep path on purpose** —
   `page.goto(BASE + '__seed__')`, chosen because it is a same-origin page that does NOT
   boot the app, so `initDB()` cannot create a v2 database before the suite opens v1. Under
   the redirect that path would go to the scope root, which DOES boot the app, and opening
   v1 would block forever. It is safe **only because it is the FIRST navigation in a fresh
   context**, before any worker exists to intercept it, and line 65 boots the app afterwards
   without ever returning. Measured 11/0 with the fix, twice, independently. **Anyone
   reordering that suite so a worker is active first will get a hang with no obvious cause.**
   A comment in place would be cheap insurance; not added here, because it is a second
   change to `main` and only one was authorised.
2. **The tree ships 19 tracked HTML documents under the worker's scope**
   (`design/approved/*.html` and the drafts), so they deploy to `…/Zajildb/design/…`. They
   were **already unreachable** with a worker installed: the baseline answers a navigation
   to one of them with the cached shell, measured by title. The redirect changes the symptom
   from "the app at a lying URL" to "the app at an honest URL"; it does not take anything
   away that was there. If those files ever need to be reachable, the fix is a network-first
   attempt for navigations, which costs offline latency and is a separate decision.

---

## The refuted ruling — recorded because the refutation came from the tree itself

Phase 7 acceptance ruling 6 directed that vanilla's `./js/app.js` be made **root-absolute**
on `main`, so the rollback path would be safe before it was needed. The intent was right and
**the mechanism was refuted by this repository's own assertions**, which is the reason it is
worth writing down.

`tests/e2e/subpath_hosting.py` — eight assertions that predate the ruling — run against a
root-absolute copy of the tree:

```
  ✗ app boots under /zajil/
  ✗ no 4xx/5xx responses   404 …/css/app.css; 404 …/js/app.js
  ✗ service worker scoped to the subdirectory   none
  ✗ manifest resolves
  ✗ 38 birds under subpath
Traceback … line 66, in <module>   Locator.inner_text: Timeout 30000ms exceeded
```

Five failures then a hard crash. The cause: vanilla is served at
`nahdaeverything-web.github.io/**Zajildb**/`, a subpath, so `/js/app.js` leaves the
deployment entirely. Measured at a simulated subpath: blank white page, 0 nav links,
**zero service-worker registrations** — and the same ruling's companion decision (ruling 1)
requires that origin to keep serving as the **export bridge**, the only route from an
existing fancier's records to the new origin. The fix would have taken down the thing the
plan depends on.

Two further facts the ruling could not have known, both measured: there are **twelve**
document-relative URLs and not one (RF-6 above), so `index.html` alone was never enough;
and no static variant works at both prefixes — `<base href="/">` is root-absoluteness
respelled, `<base href="/Zajildb/">` mirrors the break to the apex root.

**Verified in two engines.** Chromium and **WebKit 26.0** — Safari's engine, which is where
these fanciers actually are — agree in all eight cells: patched redirects to the scope root
with six nav links at the subpath and at the origin root, online and offline; baseline stays
on the deep path with zero. One methodological finding came out of it, worth keeping:
**playwright's `set_offline` is unusable with WebKit's service worker.** It breaks navigation
outright — even a plain offline reload at the scope root throws — and it reported the
UNPATCHED tree as passing, which is impossible. Offline was therefore measured by **shutting
the HTTP server down**, a real transport failure that needs no emulation. Any future
WebKit-side offline assertion has to do the same.

**The lesson is about where the knowledge of "where the app lives" belongs.** Root-absolute
paths hardcode an origin layout into the shipped shell, so one `index.html` cannot serve two
deployments. The worker derives it at runtime from `self.location`, so it is correct at any
prefix without being told. That is why the accepted fix is three lines in `sw.js` and not
eight edits across four files.

---

## RF-7 — the register's sort is not total: same-year birds are ordered by uuid

**Not a defect. A design question, recorded so it is a decision rather than an accident.**

**Where:** [`next/app/birds/view.tsx:90-94`](app/birds/view.tsx#L90) — the desktop table's
default sort is `sortK = 'year'`, `desc = true`, comparing the year and nothing else:

```js
return [...filtered].sort((a, b) => { const x = k(a), y = k(b); return (x > y ? 1 : x < y ? -1 : 0) * (desc ? -1 : 1); });
```

**What:** a loft's birds are mostly hatched across a handful of seasons, so most comparisons
are ties. `Array.prototype.sort` is stable, so ties keep source order — and source order is
`db.state.birds`, populated from IndexedDB, which returns rows in **key order: the uuid**.

**Measured.** Eight birds in two years, three trials, ids left to `uuid()`:

```
trial 1 TABLE order: 7,5,1,3,4,6,2,0     map order: 4,7,5,6,1,3,2,0   (by uuid)
trial 2 TABLE order: 5,3,7,1,6,4,0,2     map order: 6,5,4,3,7,1,0,2
trial 3 TABLE order: 5,3,1,7,0,4,2,6     map order: 0,5,3,4,2,1,7,6
```

Years sort correctly every time (2025 group, then 2024). Inside each year the table order
matches the uuid order exactly, in all three.

**Why it is NOT a bug.** A bird's uuid never changes, so for a given loft the order is
**stable** — it does not reshuffle between page loads. It is arbitrary, not unstable.

**Why it is worth a decision.** The order a fancier sees inside a season is meaningless to
them: not by ring, not by name, not by age, not by when it was added. The phone grouping
already has an answer for this — it orders by `createdAt` descending
([`view.tsx:95`](app/birds/view.tsx#L95)) — so the two surfaces disagree about what "no sort
chosen" means. A secondary key on the table (ring, or `createdAt`, to match the phone) would
make them agree. **Vanilla's table should be checked for the same shape before ruling.**

**It is not one comparator, it is a pattern.** An independent audit found the same
tie-falls-through-to-store-order shape at:
[`app/races/view.tsx:77`](app/races/view.tsx#L77) and `:87` (date desc — ties on equal or
empty dates), [`app/breeding/view.tsx:26`](app/breeding/view.tsx#L26) (nest box),
[`app/health/view.tsx:66`](app/health/view.tsx#L66) and
[`app/bird/view.tsx:107`](app/bird/view.tsx#L107) (date desc),
[`app/bird/view.tsx:176`](app/bird/view.tsx#L176) (progeny top five) and `:288` (notes by
`at`). They are latent rather than visible today because imported fixture data keeps the ids
it was created with ([`src/db/io.js:104-106`](../js/db/io.js#L104)), so only records made
with a fresh `uuid()` expose it. **The fix, if ruled, is one clause — a final
`|| a.id.localeCompare(b.id)` — applied consistently rather than per screen.**

**How it surfaced:** `fidelity/loft-home/small-1400.png` was a different picture on every
run. The first hypothesis — colliding `createdAt` in a fast fixture — was wrong, and seeding
`createdAt` changed nothing. Seeding the **ids** made it pixel-identical.

## RF-8 — the committed fidelity captures encode the timezone of the machine that made them

**Not a product defect. An artefact defect, and the reason the PNGs cannot be diffed across
machines.**

**Where:** `fmtDate` → `fmtGregorian` ([`src/i18n.js:534-546`](src/i18n.js#L534)) calls
`parseLocalDate`. A **date-only** string is parsed as local midnight and is therefore safe by
design ([`src/dates.js:44-52`](src/dates.js#L44)) — that is what the module exists for. A
value **with a time component** keeps instant semantics, and `toLocaleDateString` then
renders it in the machine's own zone.

**Measured.** `sample-data.json` stores `createdAt: "2026-08-01T09:00:00.000Z"`. At UTC+03
the bird profile renders «في زاجل منذ **1 آب 2026** (18 صفر 1448 هـ)». The same capture taken
under `TZ=Pacific/Midway` (UTC−11) renders «**31 تموز 2026** (17 صفر 1448 هـ)». The
certificate's «سجل موثق … منذ» line shifts identically.

**So the committed baseline is Samir's `+03`.** Anyone running the gate west of roughly
UTC−9 regenerates a different `bird-profile/overview-*`, `certificate/*` and `tools/*`, and
will see them as modified files with no change of their own.

**A frozen clock does not fix it** — `page.clock` sets the instant, not the zone.
`browser.new_context(timezone_id='Asia/Amman')` does, it is one argument, and it is
side-effect-free. It would also produce byte-identical output on this machine, since that is
already the zone here. **Not applied**: it touches the context creation in every suite, and
the Phase 7 close authorised the capture change only. Recorded so it is a decision.

**Related, from the same audit and worth ruling with it:** a `Locator.screenshot()` taken
before a `full_page` screenshot makes the fixed tab bar's inclusion in the full-page image a
coin flip — measured **1 of 6** with element shots first against **6 of 6** without, and
`animations='disabled'` does not change it. `shared_states.py` takes nine element shots
before its full-page shot, which is why `shared-states/full-*` carries a band nobody had
attributed.

## RF-9 — `File.text()` returns an EMPTY STRING past 512 MB, and the import trusts it

**Vanilla is exposed and is NOT being fixed here — `main` is the live deployment. Recorded for
the release checklist.** The port has the same bug and it is a RELEASE BLOCKER there, being
ruled separately.

**Where:**

| tree | line | catch? |
|---|---|---|
| vanilla | [`js/views/tools.js:113`](../js/views/tools.js#L113) — `const payload = JSON.parse(await f.text());` | **yes**, `:116-118` toasts `⚠ <message>` |
| port | `next/app/tools/view.tsx:333` — `JSON.parse(await file.text())` | **no** — nothing is surfaced at all |

`importAll()` itself is byte-identical between the trees; the difference is only the handler.

**What.** V8 caps a string at `2**29 - 24` = **536,870,888** bytes. `File.text()` does not throw
past it — **it resolves successfully with `""`**. Measured:

```
bytes=   536869864  File.text() ok=True  len=536869864  truncated=False
bytes=   536870888  File.text() ok=True  len=536870888  truncated=False   <- exactly the cap
bytes=   536871912  File.text() ok=True  len=0          truncated=True
bytes=   559396374  File.text() ok=True  len=0          truncated=True
```

So `JSON.parse("")` throws **`Unexpected end of JSON input`** — a message that describes an
empty file, not a file that was too large. Anyone reading that error would look for a
truncated download.

`new Response(file).json()` fails **identically**, measured on a 587 MB file whose largest
single value was only 2.8 MB — so the cap is on the total decoded text, not on any one value,
and there is no cheap substitution.

**Why it matters.** This is the read half of the migration path. A fancier's whole loft is on
the far side of it. The measured ceiling is **403 MB of photo bytes** (the export runs
1.3337× source), which is:

| typical photo | photos before the wall |
|---|---|
| 8 MP JPEG (~1.5 MB) | 255 |
| 12 MP JPEG (~3 MB) | 127 |
| 48 MP JPEG (~9 MB) | 42 |
| scanned A4 pedigree PNG (~20 MB) | 19 |

Photos are stored **raw** — [`app/bird/form.tsx:240`](app/bird/form.tsx#L240) hands the picker's
`File` straight to `addMedia` with no resize — so a modern phone reaches this with a few dozen
birds. This is not an edge case.

**Vanilla's exposure specifically.** Vanilla can *export* far less than the port (its own
`JSON.stringify` throws around the same size), so a vanilla user is more likely to hit the
write wall first. But vanilla can be handed a file exported by the port, and then this is the
failure — mitigated only by the `catch`, which at least says *something*.

**Not fixed here.** Recorded for the release checklist alongside the vanilla export defect.
